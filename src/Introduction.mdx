# Welcome to Atomix Design System

Atomix is a comprehensive design system built to provide a consistent and efficient way to build user interfaces. It offers a collection of pre-built, reusable components, design tokens, and guidelines to help developers and designers work together seamlessly.

## Purpose

The goal of Atomix is to accelerate development, ensure consistency across applications, and maintain a high level of quality in our user interfaces. By using Atomix, you can focus on building features rather than reinventing common UI patterns.

## Getting Started

1.  **Installation:** (Assuming you use npm or yarn)

    ```

2.  **Usage:**
    Import components and styles into your project as needed.

    ```javascript
    import { Button } from '@shohojdhara/atomix';
    import '@shohojdhara/atomix/dist/atomix.css'; // Assuming you have a main CSS file

      );
